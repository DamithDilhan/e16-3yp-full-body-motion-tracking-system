## Problems

In today's world, you will probably not go a day without hearing someone point out that they feel stressed. And
also due to the busy life, most of the people do not pay attention to do the physical health. Thefore, this 
inactive lifestyle, with too much sitting has created many helath risks to people's lives. And also in urban
places, there are not enough spaces for exercising as well.

## Solution

To overcome these issues, we are developing a game console based on body motion tracking of the players.This 
game console is a collection of sensors and wireless modules that can track the motion of the player.The
collected data is used as input for a multiplayer first-person shooter game. The smartphone is used to display
the graphics and play the sound of the game.
